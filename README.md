Project Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, we practiceed React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API with three endpoints. We learned what it's like to work with an API which we can send and receive data from.

I have built a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts', like twitter. To do that we leraned how to use APIs in React and sending requests with useEffect, and how to put the result of API response into React state to show in page. 

The requirements: 
- The page should follow the design as closely as possible
- List the most recent thoughts thats fetched from the api
- Should have a form to post new thoughts
- Should implement a heart button to send likes on a thought

I started the project by skething on the result and how many components I should have. In the beginning I had different components and my code didn't work, so I wrote everything in App.js and afterwards I devided Form, Emoji, Thoughts and Hearts in different components, which made the code easier to read.
