Project Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, we practiceed React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API with three endpoints.

We've built a simple API to collect 'happy thoughts'. It's like a personal Twitter.

In this project I had some problems to get the message to be posted when submitting the button. I serached for answers on the web and asked my team for help.
